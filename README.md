Pet Interaction

Adopting a Pet
--------------

To get started, go to the "Adopt a Pet" page. Select the type of creature you would like, give it a name, and press "Adopt." You will now be able to see this pet on your My Pets page. You may adopt as many pets as you like.

Interacting with Pets
---------------------

On the My Pets page, select the pet you would like to interact with. From here, you can choose different actions you would like to do with your pet in order to keep their stats close to 100%. Your pets stats will decrease over time, so be sure to interact with them often!

You also have the option to release your pet into the wild. Be careful; if you do this, this pet will no longer be yours and will not appear on your My Pets page. This action cannot be undone.
